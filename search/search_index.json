DockSTARTer comes with configurations to run various apps. DockSTARTer can be operated through a friendly GUI of terminal menus. DockSTARTer can be operated through commands for more advanced users who do not prefer the GUI. DockSTARTer is here to give you the freedom to choose what you want to run. DockSTARTer allows you to run apps that are not included using Overrides / Introduction . What DockSTARTer Is Not DockSTARTer is not a premade set of apps that run an exact way (you get to choose what to run and how to run it). DockSTARTer does not configure apps for you (think of it more like installing apps as a service, settings inside the app are still up to you, although our documentation will have recommendations). DockSTARTer does not configure storage for you (you may use local storage, or cloud storage, multiple disks, raid, etc). System Requirements Supported Operating Systems You must be running a Supported platform or an operating system based on a supported platform. Platforms named below will link to documentation listing compatible versions. CentOS Debian Fedora Ubuntu Any operating system based on one of the above (ex: Raspbian) should also work as long as you can install the officially supported https://get.docker.com/ script. DockSTARTer will attempt to perform this install for you if possible. Supported Hardware Any x86_64 , armv7l , or aarch64 system should be able to run one of the supported operating systems listed above. ARM CPUs may have a limited selection of supported containers.

Command Line Switches Run The Install Script sudo ds -i This script does the following: Update your system using apt-get Install curl , git , grep , and sed (git should already be installed if you started with the install instructions on the main page, but it's here just in case) Install yq - by downloading the binary from source and installing it locally, used for piecing together YAML files Install docker - by downloading via the official docker-install script, used to run containers Install docker machine completion - by downloading the binary from source and installing it locally, provides tab completion for docker in bash shell (just a nice extra to have) Install docker-compose - using python3 pip, allows configuring of containers to be run together instead of individually running each one Install docker compose completion - by downloading the binary from source and installing it locally, provides tab completion for docker-compose in bash shell (just a nice extra to have) When the script finishes it will prompt you to reboot. Run The Compose Generator sudo ds -c This script verifies the dependencies above and installs or updates them as needed, then creates a file ~/.docker/compose/docker-compose.yml based on the variables you configured in your ~/.docker/compose/.env file. The generator script will prompt to run your selected containers after creating the file. We encourage you to have a look at the generated docker-compose.yml file, however if you wish to make changes please consider using overrides. Please review the Technical Info and Overrides / Introduction pages. If you make any changes to your .env file (such as changing a port or enabling a new app) you need to rerun the generator which will rebuild only the affected containers. Update DockSTARTer sudo ds -u This should get you the latest changes to DockSTARTer. This will also backup and update your .env file. You may separately backup and update your .env file with the following command. sudo ds -e Then you may want to edit your .env file and run the generator again to bring up new apps or changes to existing apps. Setup Your Environment If you do not yet have a ~/.docker/compose/.env file: sudo ds -e Edit the file using something like nano ~/.docker/compose/.env (ctrl+x will prompt to save and exit the nano editor) Universal Section You will need to fill out all of variables in the top most Universal section. You can find your PUID by running id -u ${USER} . You can find your PGID by running id -g ${USER} . Folders should be set to a location that actually exists even if you do not intend to use them (just make an empty folder and ignore it afterwards). Inside DOCKERCONFDIR , a folder for each app will be created for it's configuration. ${TZ} You should make sure your system's timezone is set correctly, and then also supply your timezone in the TZ variable (see List of tz database time zones ). Application Variables Adding Apps You can add the variables required to run an app by running: # sudo ds -a <APPNAME> ## Example: sudo ds -a sonarr Then your .env file fill have a variable named APPNAME_ENABLED that you can true and then run the Compose Generator to start the app. You may also need to fill in or adjust any other variables prefixed with the APPNAME_ that you're enabling. This is the best place to change your default ports. Please note, Portainer and Ouroboros are enabled by default. Portainer provides a snazzy management interface at your.ip.address:9000 and Ouroboros checks for updates to the Containers you are using, NOT DockSTARTer itself. See here for a (little) more or you can disable them if you wish. Removing Apps You can remove the variables for an app by running: # sudo ds -r <APPNAME> ## Example: sudo ds -r sonarr You can also remove all variables for all apps that are disabled by running: sudo ds -r You will be prompted individually for each app and shown what will be removed. Cleanup Unused Docker Resources sudo ds -p This cleans up the DS install, p stands for prune in this case. This recovers space from old images if they were somehow left over. What Is appdata If you've heard other people talk about an appdata folder and not been sure what they meant, it's what we have had as our default ~/.docker/config since the beginning of DockSTARTer. As of today that has changed. For new installs the default DOCKERCONFDIR will be ~/.config/appdata instead of ~/.docker/config . For existing users nothing changes! You can keep your config folder right where it is. If you'd like to move your existing config to the new default location (even though you don't have to) you can do the following: Edit ~/. docker/compose/.env (in any text editor) and set DOCKERCONFDIR=~/.config/appdata And DOCKERSHAREDDIR=~/.config/appdata/shared If you're using duplicati you will also need to set DUPLICATI_BACKUPSDIR=~/.config/appdata/backups DUPLICATI_SOURCEDIR=~/.config/appdata (Unless you have these set somewhere else on purpose).

Min: Backs up your .env file Med: Backs up your .env file and the config folder for any enabled app Max: Backs up your .env file and any config folder found in your DOCKERCONFDIR. Apps will be stopped before running a backup and started after completing a backup. Med and Max also support pre/post commands in between each app (so you could disable uptime monitors for example) Min, Med, and Max support pre/post commands for the entire run. These commands can be set in .env Scheduling backups It is recommended to setup a cron job using sudo crontab -e and adding a line like 0 2 * * * /home/<USER>/.docker/main.sh -b min or 0 2 * * * /home/<USER>/.docker/main.sh -b med or 0 2 * * * /home/<USER>/.docker/main.sh -b max Which would make a daily backup at 2 AM. Backup retention The snapshot backup is created into ${BACKUP_CONFDIR}/<appname>.001 . If the folder <appname>.001 exists already it is rotated to <appname>.002 and so on, up to <appname>.512 by default (this can be adjusted), thereafter it is removed. So if you create one backup per night, for example with a cronjob, then this retention policy gives you 512 days of retention. This is useful but this can require to much disk space, that is why we have included a non-linear distribution policy. In short, we keep only the oldest backup in the range 257-512, and also in the range 129-256, and so on. This exponential distribution in time of the backups retains more backups in the short term and less in the long term; it keeps only 10 or 11 backups but spans a retention of 257-512 days. In the following table you can see on each column the different steps of the rotation, where each column shows the current set of snapshots (limited from .1 to .16 in this example): 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 14 15 15 16 16 16 To save more disk space, rsync will make hard links for each file of <appname>.001 that already existed in <appname>.002 with identical content, timestamps and ownerships. Deleting backups Backups created by DockSTARTer will be protected with a special attribute called immutable that makes the backups read only to all users including root. This is done to protect your backups from accidental deletion. Backups will be rotated through retention as described above because the backup script handles the immutable attribute.

Motivation There are a few different types of Docker networks. DockSTARTer by default uses a 'bridge' network, which is a virtual network that provides isolation from other networks, but allows containers to communicate with each other. However, some applications require access to the physical network. Both Home Assistant and Plex need physical network access for discovery (the former will have issues communicating with IoT devices otherwise). One solution might be to use Docker's host network. This however, increases the odds of port conflicts as more containers are added. Docker introduced a Macvlan network for this case which assigns a unique IP and MAC address for attached containers. Setup On Your Router Take note of the IP address of your Docker host and create a DHCP reservation for the IP if there isn't one already. Configure DHCP so it will not assign address in a given range. That range will be occupied by our container's addresses. The rest of this tutorial assumes addresses above X.X.X.190 will be free. On Your Docker Host Create the macvlan network 1 : bash docker network create -d macvlan -o parent=<myinterface> --subnet X.X.X.0/24 --gateway X.X.X.1 --ip-range X.X.X.192/27 --aux-address 'host=X.X.X.Y' mymacvlan <myinterface> is the network interface your device is receiving data from. Run ifconfig for a listing of possible interfaces. Ex: eth0 subnet and gateway are specific to your LAN subnet ip-range is the range in which Docker will assign IP addresses. This example goes from X.X.X.192 to X.X.X.223 X.X.X.Y following host should be the IP address of your Docker host. Add the following to /etc/network/interfaces after replacing information as needed: bash # Create new macvlan interface on the host ip link add mymacvlanshim link myinterface type macvlan mode bridge # Add the host address and bring up the interface ip addr add X.X.X.Y/32 dev mymacvlanshim ip link set mymacvlanshim up # Tell our host to use that interface to communicate with containers ip route add 192.168.86.192/27 dev mymacvlanshim Reboot 1 You may be wondering why we don't create the network in Docker compose. Newer versions of compose have issues with using aux-address and ip-range . In Your DockSTARTer Overrides We could connect our containers to mymacvlan and call it a day, but it's very useful to reserve IPs for each container so we can reach web endpoints in a consistent way. Add something similar to this to your docker-compose.override.yml file for each container: yaml services: ouroboros: networks: composemacvlan: ipv4_address: X.X.X.201 networks: composemacvlan: external: name: mymacvlan version: \"3.4\" The ipv4 address should fall in the range you reserved. Unfortunately, it's necessary to do this when adding new containers if you want them on the same network. After this, you should be able to compose ( sudo ds -c ) and have a new shiny macvlan network!

However, some applications require access to the physical network. Both Home Assistant and Plex need physical network access for discovery (the former will have issues communicating with IoT devices otherwise). One solution might be to use Docker's host network. This however, increases the odds of port conflicts as more containers are added. Docker introduced a Macvlan network for this case which assigns a unique IP and MAC address for attached containers.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"advanced/macvlan/#setup","text":"","title":"Setup"},{"location":"advanced/macvlan/#on-your-router","text":"Take note of the IP address of your Docker host and create a DHCP reservation for the IP if there isn't one already.

Run ifconfig for a listing of possible interfaces. Ex: eth0 subnet and gateway are specific to your LAN subnet ip-range is the range in which Docker will assign IP addresses. This example goes from X.X.X.192 to X.X.X.223 X.X.X.Y following host should be the IP address of your Docker host. Add the following to /etc/network/interfaces after replacing information as needed: bash # Create new macvlan interface on the host ip link add mymacvlanshim link myinterface type macvlan mode bridge # Add the host address and bring up the interface ip addr add X.X.X.Y/32 dev mymacvlanshim ip link set mymacvlanshim up # Tell our host to use that interface to communicate with containers ip route add 192.168.86.192/27 dev mymacvlanshim Reboot 1 You may be wondering why we don't create the network in Docker compose.

YML Files DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES DIRECTLY. Overriding these settings is easy but you must create a new file first. See the Overrides / Introduction page.

The GIT Repository for SyncLounge is located at https://github.com/samcm/synclounge .

General Setup SyncLounge works best if you have a domain to use and it is recommended that you use this with the Let's Encrypt container supported by DockSTARTer. Also, since some Plex clients can only operate over HTTP, SyncLounge needs to be accessible by HTTP or your users will need to enable mixed content in their browser for ONLY the domain SyncLounge is on. The below steps assume that you already have the Let's Encrypt container selected, configured, and running. If not, do that first or along with steps 1 & 2 below. Select SyncLounge from the DockSTARTer menu Complete the DockSTARTer configuration. Make sure to set the SYNCLOUNGE_EXTERNAL_URL setting to the appropriate domain. E.g. - synclouge.yourdomain.tld Otherwise, keep the default settings until you make sure everything is working okay Run Docker Compose. Find the file called synclounge.subdomain.conf.sample in your Let's Encrypt proxy-confs folder and rename it to synclounge.subdomain.conf . By default, this has HTTP and HTTPS enabled. Restart the letsencrypt container: docker restart letsencrypt You should now be able to go to synclouge.yourdomain.tld and use SyncLounge! Once you verify that everything is working, you can then start tinkering with settings. If you would rather have SyncLounge running under a different domain as a subfolder, you can use the synclounge.subfolder.conf.sample .

Ouroboros And Portainer Enabled By Default These tools are extremely useful for people getting used to running docker. Their official documentation should explain why but you can disable either or both of them if you want. Ouroboros will monitor (all or specified) running docker containers and update them to the (latest or tagged) available image in the remote registry. Portainer allows you to manage your Docker stacks, containers, images, volumes, networks and more! It is compatible with the standalone Docker engine and with Docker Swarm. In short, Ouroboros keeps your Containers up to date and Portainer gives you a WebGUI for starting and stopping Containers. Have a look, at www.appropriateaddress.com:9000 . DockSTARTer previously enabled Watchtower by default before Ouroboros. The two do almost the same thing, but Ouroboros has more options. General troubleshooting help You can see the (quite helpful) logs of each container with a Quick action in Portainer: Reported Issues Creating network \"compose_default\" with the default driver ERROR: could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool among the defaults to assign to the network This error can occur if your connected to a VPN while setting up the containers. Simply temporarily disconnect your VPN connection until the containers have been created and then reconnect again. Starting containers and getting the following or a similar error message: \"listen udp 0.0.0.0:5353: bind: address already in use\" As you could probably guess this means an application (most likely plex) is trying to use a port that is already in use. You can check which application it is with: sudo lsof -i :<myport> So in this example it would be: sudo lsof -i :5353 which will show you that Google Chrome is using the port you need. In this case you could just close Chrome, but there may be applications you need to uninstall for this to work properly. OpenMediaVault (OMV) We have had a recent influx of users asking for assistance in how to make OMV work with DockSTARTer (DS). DS staff have tested and confirmed the following installation method on OMV version 5.5. If you are a Linux noobie, we strongly discourage this approach because of all the issues that might arise with how OMV is built, and troubleshooting issues in OMV can be a pain. However, if you feel comfortable with Linux and want to continue down this route you will need to ensure the following: You have installed all the necessary updates that are pending in your system. You have set a DNS server in your Web GUI. You have created a user with a home directory outside of the system disk that has sudo and ssh permissions. See below in how to do that. You have a secondary disk other than the system drive mounted and formatted to anything other than NTFS. We recommend you set up a specific \"Shared Folder\" for your home directory. appdata directory should only be used to store container configurations, not home directories. SSH to your host as root. You will need to edit a system config file in order to avoid issues in the future. Run the following command (you can use your favorite text editor for this portion): nano /etc/openmediavault/config.xml We are looking for the following line: <opts>defaults,nofail,user_xattr,noexec,usrjquota=aquota.user,grpjquota=aquota.group,jqfmt=vfsv0,acl... The part you care about is the noexec bit. You will need to remove that string. Save the file and per OMV documentation you need to run omv-salt deploy run fstab . To verify that the noexec flag was removed from your drive run cat /proc/mounts and find your drive on the list. You can also run cat /proc/mounts | grep partial_drive_name . If the noexec flag is present, you skipped a step. We are now going to work on creating the directories for DS to use. You will need to create 4 shared folders and allow \"Everyone read/write\". The 4 directories will be called appdata , shared , medialibrary and home . The last directory should be where you store your user directories and you should not be using the system disk for that. If you do not know how to create a user and assign it a home directory; look up the OMV documentation as that is outside of the scope of this guide. Once the above requirements have been met, you will need to SSH to your OMV host using the account you created. First make sure your home directory was set up correctly by typing cd ~ . This shouldn't return an error, if it does read over the OMV documentation in how to properly create a user with a home directory. If no error occurs, run the following commands: sudo apt-get install curl git bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://get.dockstarter.com)\" sudo reboot After the reboot is complete, SSH back to your host using your user account and run ds , type your password and select \"Configuration\". Select \"Set Global Variables\" and select \"No\" on the next prompt. The only thing we recommend changing is the PGID to Use System 100 .

Following the instructions above, all files in ~/.config/NzbDrone would be copied to ~/.config/appdata/sonarr . After starting the new Sonarr in Docker, modify the Root Folder settings to tell Sonarr where your files are. DockSTARTer maps the true location of your media folders to locations the container expects to see such as /tv in the case of Sonarr, so that is where you will set your root folder. You will also need to modify your settings that have Sonarr connect to other apps such as Usenet or Torrent download clients. Rather than an IP address or localhost you would just use the name of the download client app, ex: nzbget as the hostname.

This is due to another service that has occupied that port disallowing DockSTARTer from installing a service on that port. Troubleshooting Methods As DockSTARTer will check and fail if another service is occupying the port, it is necessary to locate and deal with the conflict. One way is to locate the service currently occupying the port. You can do the following: # sudo netstat -ltunp | grep -w ':<port>' ## Example: sudo netstat -ltunp | grep -w ':8080' Once you locate the offending service then you can choose what to do. Resolutions/Solutions Example: If you have avahi-daemon installed this will conflict with udp/5353 port usage for iTunes in Plex if selected. This will cause the script to exit with an [ERROR] and a [FATAL]. One resolution is to change the port being bound during configuration. During configuration change the external port exposed from 5353 to 5354 (or another unused port) . This will resolve the conflict. Another resolution would be to remove the software that is in conflict. Again as the example above. If you are not using mDNS resolution then avahi-daemon would be unnecessary. Simply remove the package with apt remove avahi-daemon from the base server. This will remove the offending service and allow the port to be used by the Docker service.","title":"Port Conflicts"},{"location":"basics/port-conflicts/#port-conflicts","text":"","title":"Port Conflicts"},{"location":"basics/port-conflicts/#issueproblem","text":"During configuration the script exits with an error like the following: ERROR: for plex cannot start service plex: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint plex (5a4d78fd5ff6c4c1a978ef31): Error starting userland proxy: listen udp 0.0.0.0:5353: bind: address already in use ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project. 2019-02-13 17:38:19 [FATAL] Docker Compose failed.
